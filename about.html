                        <p class="pText">I love a good challenge. Most of my free time is spent programming, coding, or learning and buidling projects that will challenge my abilities in all areas. My very first programming language was on Apple's XCode application with swift and making mobile applications. This really peaked my interest and i moved into python, and spent about 6 years learning different use cases and building projects with python. With my knowledge of python, I realized i wanted to know more than just making a project function, i wanted to give it a face! Thats where HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and JQuery come in. I have gained a lot of knowledge in these areas and am working on expanding my knowledge in this skillset and applying it to professional and personal project.</p>

                        <p id="p1Text">One of my favorite side hobbies is building custom PCs. There's something incredibly satisfying about starting with a pile of components and transforming them into a perfectly tuned, high-performance machine. So far, I’ve built two personal PCs from the ground up—each one tailored to my specific needs and aesthetics. <br><br>Beyond my own setups, I love helping friends and others pick the best parts for their goals—whether it’s gaming, content creation, or just everyday use. I always take the time to carefully consider the balance between performance, compatibility, airflow, and budget. <br><br>For me, it’s more than just assembling hardware—it's about attention to detail, from smart component selection to clean cable management and a polished final look. Every build is a reflection of both function and form, and I take pride in making sure it all comes together seamlessly.</p>

                    <p class="p2Text">Cars have always been a big part of my life, and my passion for them runs deep. I’m especially loyal to Chevrolet, and I’m proud to own a Camaro—a car that’s not just transportation, but an ongoing project and expression of who I am. <br><br>I love working on my build, constantly refining it and drawing inspiration from other car enthusiasts. Whether it’s tweaking performance, styling, or just keeping it clean and sharp, it’s all part of the journey. <br><br>Going to car meets and events is one of my favorite things to do. There’s nothing like being surrounded by others who share the same love for the road, the roar of an engine, and the craftsmanship behind every ride. Every event brings new ideas and motivation for what’s next in my Camaro’s evolution.</p>
